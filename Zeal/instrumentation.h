// Instrumentation for EverQuest gameplay, written against the OpenTelemetry **API** only.
//
// Nothing here includes an sdk/ or exporters/ header, and nothing here knows where telemetry goes.
// If no SDK has been registered (see telemetry.h) every call is a no-op that costs a virtual call -
// so call sites need no #ifdef and no "is telemetry on?" check.
//
// Instruments are created once, on first use, and cached. That is only sound because the providers
// live for the process: the Resource is fixed at startup and everything that varies while the game
// runs - the character above all - travels as a measurement attribute.
