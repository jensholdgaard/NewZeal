// OtlpExporter is the instrumentation half of the exporter: it hooks the game, decides what a hit,
// heal, or fight means, and encodes those into OTLP payloads. Everything that touches the network -
// the worker thread, the flush timer, delivery and send statistics - lives in OtlpClient, which
// knows nothing about EverQuest.
//
// All three signals are emitted: logs (chat lines), metrics (combat, character, group) and traces
// (zone sessions parenting fight spans). Game-thread callbacks only ever append to state; the
// worker thread reads it through collect().
